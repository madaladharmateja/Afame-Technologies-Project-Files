# Afame-Technologies-Project-Files


**Objective:**

The objective of this project was to conduct data analysis on HR data provided by Afame Technologies. The tasks involved data cleansing, which includes removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns, eliminating redundant entries, sanitizing specific columns, and eliminating NaN values. The aim was to prepare the dataset for further analysis and to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

**Tasks Performed:**

* **Removed unnecessary columns:** The unnecessary columns were identified and removed to streamline the dataset and focus only on relevant information.
*** Renamed columns:** The column names were updated to make them more descriptive and understandable, enhancing the dataset's readability.
* **Eliminated redundant entries:** Redundant entries, if any, were identified and removed to avoid duplication and maintain data integrity.
* **Sanitized specific columns:** Certain columns required sanitization to ensure consistency and accuracy of the data, adhering to predefined standards.
* **Eliminated NaN values:** NaN (Not a Number) values were identified and eliminated from the dataset to prevent skewing of analysis results and ensure completeness of the data.

**Insights/Observations:**

* The data cleansing process significantly improved the quality and usability of the dataset, making it more suitable for analysis purposes.
* Renaming columns facilitated easier interpretation of the data, enabling users to quickly understand the information conveyed by each column.
* Removal of redundant entries helped streamline the dataset and avoid unnecessary duplication of information, reducing the risk of errors in analysis.
* Sanitizing specific columns ensured that the data adhered to predefined standards and maintained consistency across the dataset.
* Elimination of NaN values enhanced the completeness of the dataset, enabling more accurate and reliable analysis results.
